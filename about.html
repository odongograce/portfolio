            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I am a software developer with a curious mind and a drive to build
                solutions that actually solve problems.
                My journey into tech started with a fascination
                for how systems work and has grown into a passion
                for crafting clean, efficient, and scalable applications.

            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>
                From tinkering with small coding projects to
                collaborating on real-world applications,
                I've developed a strong foundation in programming,
                Linux, and networking. What excites me most about
                software development is the endless
                opportunity to learn, adapt, and innovate.

            <h3>What I Love Building</h3>
            <p>
                I enjoy developing user-focused solutions — from simple
                tools that make everyday tasks easier to larger
                projects that help businesses
                run smoothly. Every line of code I write is about
                blending functionality, performance, and simplicity.

            <h3>Beyond Coding</h3>
            <p>
                When I'm not immersed in a project, you'll find me
                exploring emerging tech trends, experimenting with
                personal projects, or enjoying quiet moments to
                recharge. For me,
                growth is a journey — and I'm here for every step of it.
